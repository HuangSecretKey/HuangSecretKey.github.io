A large proportion of waste from households is not recycled. Many people consider it necessary to enforce laws to deal with problems. This may be a visable solution, but I donnot agree that it is the only option.

If recycling waste is legally required, people may possibily do it, otherwise, they will be  punished. Regulatory requirements serve as a desertrent as any punishment, either fine or a community order. If they pay a fine for failing to sort rubbish, they will have less money for living expenses. In cases where they reoffend,they may even be required to clean streets and pick up litter in public. To avoid these consquences, people will choose to dispose of waste in the same ways as instructed by the government.

Despite the potential outcome of legal approach, it may not be necessary when gonvernment has successfully educated public recycle as much waste as possible. People dump waste recklessly because they donot relise the environmental benefit of recycling and appropriate ways to do it. if schools and communities disseminate knowledge about resuing rubbish, all citizens form habits of reusing waste whenever possible from a young age. Some publicity compaigns, for instance, provide information about what items can be recycled and what facilitates collect these items. If people take recycling as a normal part of their lives, they would engage in activity voluntarily in the absence of tough laws.

In conclusion, legal change may be required in some communities and countries where people donnot feel the need to recycle, but it is unnecessary if people has been taught to develop this habit since childhood.
